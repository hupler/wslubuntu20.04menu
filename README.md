# Batch Script with WSL Commands

This is a Windows batch script that incorporates WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) commands. The script provides a simple menu with options to start, shut down, execute quick commands, and set up certain configurations.

## Menu Options

1. **Start Ubuntu-20.04:** Initiates the Ubuntu-22.04 WSL instance, and runs a keepalive script in the background.
2. **Shutdown:** Shuts down all running WSL instances.
3. **Quick Run Command:** Allows the user to input a custom command for execution.
4. **Setup Menu:** Sets up certain configurations, including creating a `keepalive.sh` script.

## Usage

- Execute the script, and a menu will appear with numbered options.
- Choose the desired option by entering the corresponding number.

## Quick Run Command

- When selecting option 3, you can enter commands for execution.
- For example, entering `8747` will return you to the main menu.
- Entering `shell` will start a shell, and typing `exit` will return to the main menu.

## Setup Menu

- Option 4 sets up specific configurations, including creating a `keepalive.sh` script.
- After executing the setup, reopen the program for changes to take effect.

## Note
